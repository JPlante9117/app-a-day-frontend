App a day is a React application for keeping track of job applications and personal goals all in one place. As companies use many different job boards for their application process, the ability to store them all in one place with a simple link to check them helps to stay organized.


## Note

This is **only** the front end of the application. Please also install the [App A Day API](https://github.com/JPlante9117/app-a-day-api "App A Day API") and follow its README for setup.

## Installation

Use the package manager ```npm install``` to install all the necessary dependencies while inside the root of the App A Day Frontend folder.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

**Before running the following steps, make sure the backend is set up and running.**

Start up the local server with
```bash
npm start
```

Double check the terminal to see the host port for the application (It defaults to localhost:3000).

Once the application is open, you will see a homepage and then dashboard after a brief delay. The dashboard keeps track of the jobs that you have applied for and the goals you have set. Use the navbar on top to see more details on jobs or goals.

In either of those tabs you may create, edit, and delete any jobs/goals you have made.
